Forecastify is a simple weather web app that shows the weather of the desired city.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create Forecastify. 

Forecastify is fully responsive, so it will work and look good on any device.

Also, I used several API-s:
<ul>
  <li>OpenWeatherMap API that shows all relevant weather information.</li>
  <li>The Unsplash API that shows pictures of cities.</li>
  <li>REST Countries API that shows the flag of selected city.</li>
</ul>
